stay
cynical
problems have solutions, dilemmas have horns
this is a half-truth
fly the flag of
tax havens
pretending
limit conflicts
to pay their bills
create
footprint
a grain of history
ideaologues
endure
that's how change begins: You stop
you start walking the other direction
fat cats
overwhelmingly middle class
overwhelming middle
abroad
follow
the minnows in the same tank as the sharks
Don't call me 'queer'
I have resisted
even after
weaponize
queer relamation camp
What was wrong with "gay"?
